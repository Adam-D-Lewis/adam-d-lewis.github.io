# LinkedIn Post: Building Polished Bespoke Solutions Fast with Vibe Coding

**Ever built something "quick and dirty" that you couldn't use 6 months later?** ðŸ“¸

My wife needed help organizing thousands of duplicate photos across multiple Google accounts. With a newborn at home and limited coding time, I had maybe 2 hours to solve this.

Instead of a throwaway script, I used "vibe coding" - that AI-assisted flow state - to build something better: a proper Python package with tests, documentation, and clean architecture.

**The result?** A tool that:
âœ… Organizes photos into YYYY/MM/DD folders using EXIF data
âœ… Detects duplicates with SHA256 hashing 
âœ… Handles edge cases gracefully
âœ… Can be extended and maintained later

**The real win isn't speed right now** - I could have hacked something together just as fast. It's maximizing the value of precious coding time by building solutions that respect your future self.

This is one of my favorite things about vibe coding: my side projects are so much easier to reuse and extend later. No more abandoned scripts I'm afraid to touch. When time is limited, AI-assisted development helps you create quality foundations instead of technical debt. 

What problems are you solving with AI coding assistance?
